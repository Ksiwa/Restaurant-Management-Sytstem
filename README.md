üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Management System
This project was developed in collaboration with my teammates nemakun0 and gksukesenn, with the goal of providing a customizable restaurant management system tailored for local businesses. The system supports role-based access with dedicated interfaces for Admin, Waiter, and Chef.
